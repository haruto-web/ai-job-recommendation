OpenAI integration in your website works through several components:

Backend (Laravel/PHP)
OpenAIService.php - Core service class that handles all OpenAI API interactions:

Uses GPT-3.5-turbo model for various AI tasks
Methods include:
extractSkillsFromResume() - Extracts skills from resume text
analyzeResumeComprehensively() - Full resume analysis (skills, experience, education, etc.)
matchJobToUser() - Calculates job-user match scores
suggestJobsForSkills() - Suggests job titles based on user skills and experience
AiController.php - API controller with two main endpoints:

/api/ai/skill-chat - Takes user skills and experience, returns job suggestions with confidence scores
/api/ai/chat - Conversational AI chat for career advice
Fallback System: If OpenAI API key is not configured, the system falls back to local text-matching algorithms for job suggestions and simple rule-based responses for chat.

Frontend (React)
ChatBot.js - React component that provides the conversational interface:

Floating chat button (ðŸ’¬) that opens a chat panel
Sends user messages to /api/ai/chat endpoint
Displays AI responses in a chat-like interface
App.js - Integrates the ChatBot component globally:

Shows the chat button for logged-in users
Manages chat open/close state
How It Works
Resume Analysis: When users upload resumes, OpenAI analyzes the text to extract skills, experience, education, and other details
Job Matching: Uses AI to match user profiles with job requirements
Career Chat: Provides conversational AI assistance for job search, career advice, and skill development
Job Suggestions: Based on user skills, suggests relevant job titles with confidence scores
The system is designed to be robust - if OpenAI isn't available, it gracefully falls back to simpler algorithms to ensure the site remains functional.
